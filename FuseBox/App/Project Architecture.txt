Project Architecture:

1. **Frontend** (React.js)
   - Handles user interface and interactions.
   - Makes API calls to the backend for data and calculations.
   - Key Features:
     - User Authentication (login, registration).
     - Project Management (creating, editing, and deleting projects).
     - Display of equipment, rooms, and floors.

2. **Backend** (ASP.NET Core)
   - Acts as the business logic layer of the system.
   - Interacts with the database and processes calculations.
   - Key Components:
     - **Controllers**: Handle API requests from the frontend.
       - ProjectController: Manages CRUD operations for projects.
       - UserController: Handles authentication and user data.
       - StatisticsController: Returns energy consumption statistics.
     - **Services**:
       - ConfigurationService: Handles project and equipment configuration.
       - CalculationService: Provides methods like CalculateTotalPower.
       - NotificationService: Sends alerts to the frontend.
     - **Models**: Represent objects like `ProjectConfiguration`, `Room`, `Floor`, etc.

3. **Database** (MySQL on PHPMyAdmin)
   - Stores persistent data.
   - Tables:
     - `Users`:
       - `UserId` (PK), `Username`, `Email`, `PasswordHash`, etc.
     - `Projects`:
       - `ProjectId` (PK), `ProjectName`, `UserId` (FK), `CreatedDate`, etc.
     - `Floors`:
       - `FloorId` (PK), `ProjectId` (FK), `FloorName`, etc.
     - `Rooms`:
       - `RoomId` (PK), `FloorId` (FK), `Name`, `ZoneType`, etc.
     - `Equipment`:
       - `EquipmentId` (PK), `RoomId` (FK), `Name`, `Power`, etc.
     - `Logs` (for diagnostics):
       - `LogId` (PK), `Timestamp`, `LogLevel`, `Message`, etc.

4. **Data Flow**:
   - **Frontend to Backend**:
     - User submits data (e.g., creates a project or room).
     - Data is sent via API calls to the backend.
   - **Backend Processing**:
     - Backend validates and processes the data.
     - Interacts with the database to store or retrieve information.
     - Performs calculations using `CalculationService` if required.
   - **Backend to Frontend**:
     - Processed data or results (e.g., total power calculations, project details) are sent back to the frontend for display.

5. **Scalability Considerations**:
   - **Frontend**:
     - Optimize React components and state management.
     - Use a content delivery network (CDN) for faster asset delivery.
   - **Backend**:
     - Deploy on cloud platforms like Azure or AWS for scaling.
     - Implement load balancing to handle high traffic.
     - Use caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data.
   - **Database**:
     - Normalize tables for efficient storage.
     - Index frequently queried columns.
     - Scale horizontally using read replicas for high read traffic.
   - **Security**:
     - Use HTTPS for all communications.
     - Encrypt sensitive data like passwords (e.g., bcrypt hashing).
     - Validate all inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.

6. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Add real-time notifications using SignalR or WebSocket.
   - Implement a mobile-friendly UI.
   - Add advanced analytics for energy consumption trends.
   - Introduce multi-language support.
